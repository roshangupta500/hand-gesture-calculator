# hand-gesture-calculator
A Hand Gesture Calculator uses OpenCV for webcam input, MediaPipe to detect 21 hand landmarks, and NumPy for gesture feature extraction. Gestures (digits, +, −, ×, ÷, =) are recognized via ML/rule-based logic, logged with pandas, and mapped to calculator actions. It enables touch-free, real-time math expression input.
